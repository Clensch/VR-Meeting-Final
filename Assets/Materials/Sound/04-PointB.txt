Point B. Reward system.
Management is aware that intrinsic motivation alone is not always enough to push employees to their limits.
Therefore, the idea was expressed to additionally motivate the employees extrinsically. 
It would be an option to increase the salary of the remaining employees, but this would possibly jeopardize our set savings targets.
Therefore we decided to introduce a points system. The points are called pointies and are awarded in case of beneficial behaviour. 
Examples of beneficial behavior include working overtime, skipping lunch breaks, answering emails in your free time, and so on.
Employees can then exchange the pointies they have earned for bonuses, such as attractive mugs bearing the company logo.
