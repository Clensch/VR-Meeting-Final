Point A. Motivation through frustration.
This is an old motto that I have taken to heart during my time in the Bundeswehr. 
The idea is to frustrate the employees to such an extent that they develop a "now more than ever" mentality and are motivated to work harder on themselves and their projects. 
For this purpose the management decided to change our code base from "Python" to the programming language "Brainfuck". 
"Brainfuck" is characterized by the fact that though it is Turing Complete, it is very difficult to read. 
We assume that it leads to maximum frustration to develop more complex programs in "Brainfuck", which accordingly leads to maximum motivation.
