Point C. The right music during programming.
Like the artists of the Renaissance, in this company we try to orientate ourselves towards the ancient world.
An example of the efficiency of this period were the old galleys. In these galleys the rowers were motivated to drive the ship by rhythmic drumming.
The idea is to use this method to push our employees forward. For this purpose, we would hire drummers who would set a beat in which our programmers could then write their code.
The speed of the beat can of course be adapted to the needs of the company!
